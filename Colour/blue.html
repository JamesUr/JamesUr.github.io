<h1>Blue</h1>
<p>A survey in 10 countries found that blue is the most popular "favorite color" for people globally, with men preferring blue more often than women (40% versus 24%, respectively, among subjects from the United States).</p>
<p>Because blue is favored by so many people, it is often viewed as a non-threatening color that can seem conservative and traditional.</p>
<p>Blue can also create feelings of sadness. Consider how a painting that heavily features blue, such as those produced by Picasso during his "blue period," can seem lonely or sad.</p>
<p>Blue is one of the most popular colors, but it is also one of the least appetizing. weight loss programs even recommend eating your food off a blue plate as Blue rarely occurs naturally in food. Also, humans have evolved to avoid foods that are poisonous, and blue coloring in food is often a sign of spoilage or poison.</p>
<p>Here's what the color blue means in various areas of the world: India: Blue represents "truth", "mercy", and "love". Latin America: Blue is associated with "mourning", but also "trust" and "tranquility". North America: Blue is "soothing" and signifies a "trustworthy person" or official business. United Kingdom: Blue symbolizes "tranquility" and "dignity". Western European countries: Blue is "truth", "reliability" and "responsibility".</p>

<p>Name:<br>Blue Light Exposure: Ocular Hazards and Prevention—A Narrative Review<br> </p>
<p>Authors:<br>Audrey Cougnard-Gregoire, Bénédicte M. J. Merle, Tariq Aslam, Johanna M. Seddon, Isabelle Aknin, Caroline C. W. Klaver, Gerhard Garhöfer, Alfredo Garcia Layana, Angelo Maria Minnella, Rufino Silva, and Cécile Delcourt<br> </p>
<p>Aim:<br>The objective of this narrative review is to provide an update on the ocular consequences of blue light exposure and to discuss the efficiency of methods of protection against potential blue light-induced injury on eyes.<br> </p>
<p>Sample:<br>N/A<br></p>
<p>Procedure:<br>The search of relevant articles was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar until December 2022. According to the different topics examined in the present narrative review, several keys words have been used:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(blue light) or (blue light) and effect* and health*</li>
	<li>(blue light or blue light) and effect* and (eye* or ophthalmo* or vision* or ocular* or visual disorder or retina* or macula*)</li>
	<li>(blue light filtering) or (blue light blocking) or (blue light-filtering) or (blue light-blocking)</li>
	<li>(blue light or blue light or blue-blocking) and (prevent* or protect* or advice* or guideline* or blocking or filtering)</li>
	<li>(blue light or blue light) and (filter or eye or retina or macula) and (antioxidant or carotenoid or lutein or zeaxanthin or nutrition or vitamin)</li>
</ul>
<p>Original articles, reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and epidemiological studies were included. Only articles in English have been included. No selection was done on the type of population studied (human population, animal models, or in vitro trials were included). Reference lists of original research articles and reviews were also checked to identify relevant articles.<br></p>
<p>Results:<br>With age, the absorption of blue light by the lens changes, with shorter wavelengths in the blue and violet regions of the visible spectrum more prominently affected. Blue light may induce also photodynamic damages in aging lenses. The absorption of blue light in the lens is produced by the structural proteins, protein metabolites, and enzymes absorbing blue light-producing yellow pigments, in particular through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lens epithelial cells mitochondria. This leads gradually to the lens darkening and yellowing, leading to cataract. A blue light wavelength in the blue–violet spectrum with long duration exposure produces ROS in the retina, which react with specific DNA components or the cell membranes, leading to cell dysfunction or cell apoptosis. A large number of studies on animal models or human retinal cells have reported severe photochemical injury of the retina induced by excessive exposure to blue light with wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm (blue light hazard).<br> </p>
<p>Conclution:<br>Because they can be powerful and potentially blue-rich, LEDs need to be systematically assessed for photobiological safety. Standards exist (in France, only for lamps and not for luminous objects) and should be applied, but there are currently no standards for limiting values for chronic exposure. There is no evidence to date that LEDs, in normal use at domestic intensity levels, or used as backlights in screen devices, are retinotoxic to humans or can led to cataract, with respect to short-term exposure for the use of LEDs with warm white (yellow) light. Regarding young children, there is some concern about the effect of blue light, since they have an immature optical system allowing blue light to reach the retina. Conversely, exposure to blue–violet light has been shown to reduce the risk for myopia in children, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the safety of blue light exposure in children.<br> </p>
