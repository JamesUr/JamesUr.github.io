<h1>Red</h1>
<p>In different cultures, people associate red with anger. This makes sense given that many people get "red in the face" from increased blood flow when they're angry.</p>
<p>Research has found that there is a link between the colour red and perceived dominance. For instance, wearing a red uniform may cause an athlete to feel dominant and perform more aggressively. Alternatively, athletes in red may be seen as more aggressive, more dominant, and more likely to win a physical competition not only by their opponents but also by the referees.</p>
<p>But red does not always mean danger and aggression. red can also symbolizes passion, love, and desire. This could explain why people wearing red are rated as more attractive by the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Red can also mean power. For Example, the "power tie" worn by businessmen across the globe is, traditionally, red. And the "red carpet" that is only rolled out for celebrities and other high influence inderviduals.</p>

<h1>Study</h1>
	
<p>Name: <br>The power of red: The influence of colour on evaluation and failure â€“ A replication<br></p>
<p>Authors: <br>Jana Fikrlova, Lenka Cechova, Tereza Lebedova, Patrik Pycha, Alena Sesulkova, Jakub Prochazka, Martin Vaculik<br></p>
<p>Aim: <br>Examine the influence of the colour of a pen on the activation of associations with failure and the focus on errors.<br></p>
<p>Sample: <br>198 students of Czech universities from various fields. The participants were approached on the premises of their universities. We did not include students of pedagogy, Czech language and proofreading<br></p>
<p>Procedure: <br>We assigned two tasks to 198 students who completed them using either a red or a blue pen. The students were instructed to complete several word stems in the first task. In the second, we asked them to mark mistakes in a text. The participants using red pens completed significantly more word stems with words associated with failure than those using blue pens. The participants using red pens also marked significantly more mistakes in a text than those using blue pens.<br></p>
<p>Results: <br>Our results support the findings of the original study and the hypothesized influence of the colour red in inducing a higher activation of associations with failure and a heightened focus on mistakes.<br></p>
<p>Conclution: <br>In this study, we replicated the research of Rutchick et al. (2010) which focused on the influence of the colour red on the activation of associations with failure and its influence on increasing the focus on mistakes. In accordance with the authors of the original study, we presumed the colour red would influence the accessibility of the words related to failure and the tendency to find mistakes while correcting a text. We found support for both of our hypotheses.<br></p>
