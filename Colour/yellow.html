<h1>Yellow</h1>
<p>Yellow is often known as being a high-energy color. It is used in situations and products to create a sense of "excitement" or "energy".</p>
<p>While it can be an energetic color, the intensity can have a downside. Sometimes yellow can come off as very "aggressive" and even "confrontational". Some people may be left feeling irritated or even angry when surrounded by the colour yellow.</p>
<p>The effects of yellow can complex. Not everyone responds to the color in the same way. While some people might find it "bright" and "cheery", others may find it "grating" and "obnoxious".</p>
<p>For many people, yellow is a "bright" and "cheerful" color. Advertisers can use it to not only draw attention because of its brightness but also to evoke a sense of happiness.</p>

<h1>Study</h1>
	
<p>Name:<br>What makes people happy when skies are gray? The color yellow<br> </p>
<p>Authors:<br>Eva Frederick (Article) and Christine Mohr, Nele Dael, Domicele Jonauskaite, and Déborah Epicoco (Survey)<br> </p>
<p>Aim:<br>To find out what factors might play a role, researchers tested a new hypothesis: What if people's physical surroundings affect their feelings about certain colors? For instance, if someone lived in cold and rainy Finland, would they feel differently about the color yellow from someone who lived near the Sahara Desert?<br> </p>
<p>Sample:<br>"6625 people in 55 countries."<br> </p>
<p>Procedure:<br>The researchers looked at color-emotion data from an ongoing international survey of 6625 people in 55 countries. The survey asks participants to rate 12 colors on how closely they are associated with feelings including joy, pride, fear, and shame. The team looked only at the data for yellow, and analyzed how different factors—including hours of sunshine, hours of daylight, and amount of rainfall—lined up with the emotions people reported for the color. The two best predictors of how people felt about yellow were the annual amount of rainfall, and how far they lived from the equator<br> </p>
<p>Results:<br>The farther someone lived from the equator, the more likely they were to appreciate some bright hues: In Egypt, the likelihood of yellow being associated with joy was just 5.7%, whereas in chilly Finland it was 87.7%. In the United States, with its moderate climate and amber waves of grain, people's yellow-joy association levels were between 60% and 70%.<br> </p>
<p>Conclution:<br>N/A<br> </p>
