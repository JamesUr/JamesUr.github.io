<h1>Green</h1>
<p>Shades of green can help make people more relaxed in a new places. For this reason, designers often use green in public spaces such as restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>Green can link to health and good lifesytle. Science actually backs up this idea with many studies implicating green links to favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>Green also has calming effects that may assosiated with nature, which people link with relaxing and refreshing. Some researchers think that the color green is hardwired in our brains from evolution: Early humans knew that green in nature indicated food, water, and shelter.</p>
<p>Although some find green a relaxing color, others say it motivates them. One study found that people with a "high need for achievement" more consistently chose the color green over the color red, which was more often chosen by those with a "low need for achievement."</p>
<p>Color influences not only our emotions but also our memories. One study gave people with a list of words link with emotions written in different colors. They were then asked to recall specific words. They were more likely to recall positive words written in green.</p>

<h1>Study</h1>
	
<p>Name:<br>Effect of colored filters on reading capabilities in dyslexic children<br> </p>
<p>Authors:<br>Milena Razuk, Faustine Perrin-Fievez, Christophe Loic Gerard, Hugo Peyre, José Angelo Barela, Maria Pia Bucci<br> </p>
<p>Aim:<br>The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of colored filters on reading performance and eye movement control in children with and without dyslexia.<br> </p>
<p>Sample:<br>36 children, 18 children with dyslexia and 18 children without dyslexia<br> </p>
<p>Procedure:<br>Participants were seated on a chair with their heads stabilized by a forehead and chin support. The children read different texts under the following three filter conditions: no filter, yellow filter, and green filter. The children’s eye movements were recorded with a Mobile EyeBrain Tracker. Reading total time, duration of fixation between two successive saccades, pro-saccades amplitude and number of pro- and retro-saccades were obtained.<br> </p>
<p>Results:<br>Children with dyslexia read the fastest and had the shortest fixation time in the green filter condition compared with the other conditions. Furthermore, children with dyslexia showed the shortest fixation time in the green filter condition with respect to the other conditions.<br> </p>
<p>Conclution:<br>Taken together, these results suggested that the green filter improved reading performance in children with dyslexia because the filter most likely facilitated cortical activity and decreased visual distortions.<br> </p>
